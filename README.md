# ml-adult-census-income

Machine Learning project based on a popular [Adult Census Income dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income) extracted from a 1994 US census bureau database.

Some of our files are organized by the application of one-hot vs label encoders to our dataset, as a potential form of comparison between the models.
